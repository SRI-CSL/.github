# SRI International's Computer Science Laboratory


The Computer Science Laboratory studies the logical foundations of
scalable systems that are beyond the scope of traditional testing or
simulation, and builds and applies efficient high-level tools for
rigorous mechanical analysis. Current systems of interest include not
only traditional computer hardware and software, but also biological
systems and nanoelectronics.
